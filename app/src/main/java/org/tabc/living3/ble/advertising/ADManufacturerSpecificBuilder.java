     * @param data
     *         The AD data. It is the third and following octets
     *         of the byte sequence of the AD structure. Note that

     *         company ID.

     *         The company ID. It is the value generated by
     *         interpreting the third and fourth octets of the
     *         byte sequence of the AD structure in little endian.

     *         instance, {@code null} should be returned.
